    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...<br>
    And all through the house...<br></p>
    <p>Nothing was stirring; not even a mouse</p>
    <p>Then, the wind blew hard outside the window</p>
    <p>It blew the window open and rain poured inside. 
        Creating a puddle in the kitchen</p>
    <p>The puddle reveals a dip in the kitchen floor.<br>
    "Damn, damn, damn!" she screamed as the floor began to 
sink in.</p>
    <p>The water began to morph into an impossibly large whirlpool.</p>
    <p>The whirlpool engulfed the entire kitchen and swallowed the kids and dog! </p>
    <p>More screaming ensued as she tried to grasp what was actually happening. How? Why her?</p>
